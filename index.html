<h1>Stra√üenbahn Ulm - Better tram network</h1>
<p>This page is my idea on how Ulm should design and build their future tram network.</p>
  <p>First of all, we will begin with Hauptbahnhof, the main train station.  In my opinion, this should be the central station for the entire tram network.</p>
  <p>If you look at Stuttgart, you can see that Hauptbahnhof, and not Charlottenplatz, is where the magic happens.</p>
  <p>In Ulm, Ehinger Tor is Charlottenplatz.</p>
  <p>Ok, so firstly, the tram station Hauptbahnhof should be rotated by 90 degrees, and should run under the tracks of the train station.</p>
